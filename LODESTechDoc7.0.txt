         LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) Dataset Structure
                                  Format Version 7.0

Introduction
The LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) datasets are released both as
      part of the OnTheMap application and in raw form as a set of comma separated variable
      (CSV) text files. This document describes the structure of those raw files and provides
      basic information for users who want to perform analytical work on the data outside of
      the OnTheMap application.

File Organization
At the root distribution level, each state has a directory named by its lowercase, 2-letter postal
code. Within each state directory are directories of data as well as metadata and geography files
for the state. These are described below.

Data Files
The CSV data files are released at the state level and they are organized into three groups within
each state. The three groups of files are named as follows, according to their contents:

         OD – Origin-Destination data, jobs totals are associated with both a home Census Block and a
                work Census Block
         RAC – Residence Area Characteristic data, jobs are totaled by home Census Block
         WAC – Workplace Area Characteristic data, jobs are totaled by work Census Block

Metadata Files and Geography
Within the state directory are two text files. One is a version document, called “version.txt”, and
the other is a “checksum” file. Also in the state directory is a geographic relationship file
(referred to here as a “geography crosswalk”). This geography crosswalk is new to the Format
Version 7.0 release.

The version file contains information about the state, the data vintage, and the format version.
The “data vintage” is an eight character code based on the date the data was prepared for release;
it is the form of YYYYMMDD.1 New or corrected data may cause newer vintages of data to be
released. Only files that have new or changed data will be included in future vintages. The
“format version” is a number that refers to file organization and structure of the data release and
is fully defined by this document. Restructuring of the existing data into different file formats or
a different organization structure would result in a change in the format version.

The checksum file in each state directory is an MD5SUM file, called “otm_[ST].md5sum” where
[ST] is the respective state postal code. With the correct software tools, the MD5SUM file can be
used to check that the individual data files were downloaded without any file corruption or loss
of data. Further information on MD5SUM can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Md5sum.

  Note: The data vintage is not the same as the createdate provided within the data files. The createdate refers to an
internal processing point, while the data vintage is the code that refers to a specific release of public OnTheMap
data.

The geography crosswalk is a relationship file that establishes the hierarchical connection
between each 2010 census tabulation block and all higher level geographic entities supported by
the OnTheMap system. The geography crosswalk file is distributed as a Gzipped (see below)
CSV. More detail about this file, including the layout, is available in the Geography Crosswalk
section below.

A typical directory tree looks as follows:
\
|-- ak
|   |-- od
|   |   `-- (individual origin-destination data files)
|   |-- rac
|   |   `-- (individual residence area characteristics data files)
|   `-- wac
|   |   `-- (individual workplace area characteristics data files)
|   |-- ak_xwalk.csv.gz
|   |-- otm_ak.md5sum
|   `-- version.txt
|-- az
|
(more states)

For users who want to automate the download of LODES data files, the root location of the
directory structure is http://lehd.ces.census.gov/onthemap/LODES7/ This location cannot be
accessed directly via a web browser. Instead, users can direct their browsers to
http://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/#lodes for single-file downloads.

All CSV files are compressed using a GZip algorithm, which appends a “.gz” to the end of the
filename. Most commonly used compression/extraction software packages can decompress these
files (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)).

Data Coverage and Availability
Data are currently available for most states in most years. The LED Partnership consists of 53
State and Territorial Partners, of which 50 are producing data for OnTheMap. With the
exceptions listed below all 50 states have OD, RAC, and WAC data for all 10 years of data
(2002-2011).

Datasets for 2009-2011 contain additional variables (Race, Ethnicity, Education, and Sex) on the
RAC and WAC files that are not available in other years of data.2 And datasets for 2011 contain
further additional variables (Firm Age and Firm Size) on the WAC files.3,4 The data structure for
all years of data has been expanded to include space for these new variables, but in earlier years
these variables contain only zeroes. See the File Naming Conventions and File Structure segment
of this document for more information.

2
  Race, Ethnicity, Educational Attainment, and Sex variables are made available through a Beta release.
3
  Firm Age and Firm Size are made available through a Beta release.
4
  Additionally, Firm Age and Firm Size are only made available for the All Private Jobs job type (JT02).




                                                    2                                          Rev. 20130606
Datasets for 2010 and later contain additional Job Types that cover Federal Employment. The
data structure is outlined in the File Naming Conventions and File Structure segment of this
document.

States and territories which are not in “regular production” do have RAC datasets available,
however these only include jobs for workers employed in the 50 OnTheMap states. The partners
that are not in regular production for the purposes of LODES/OnTheMap are Massachusetts,
Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Due to historical unavailability a handful of state-year combinations of data are not part of
LODES/OnTheMap. These are Arizona (2002 and 2003), Arkansas (2002), the District of
Columbia (2002-2009), Mississippi (2002 and 2003), and New Hampshire (2002). These specific
state-year combinations will have only RAC files and not OD or WAC files, similar to those
states not in regular production. For a state-year with a full complement of data, in 2009 and
earlier there are 8 OD files, 40 RAC files, and 40 WAC files. Starting with 2010 and going
forward there are 12 OD files, 60 RAC files, and 60 WAC files. In some cases, individuals files
produced for a state-year combination may contain no data because there are no jobs in the
specific combination of state-year-jobtype-filetype. When this occurs the individual file still
exists, but only contains the file header as specified below.

Geography Vintage
LODES Version 7.0 is enumerated with 2010 census blocks. Prior to LODES Version 6.0, data
releases used 2000 census blocks as the base vintage. Basic information on 2010 census blocks
can be found at http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/tgrshp2010/tgrshp2010.html and at
http://www.census.gov/geo/www/2010census/. General information on the relationships between
2000 census blocks and 2010 census blocks can be found at
http://www.census.gov/geo/www/2010census/rel_blk.html. The methods used to translate
historical data into 2010 census blocks can be found at
http://lehd.ces.census.gov/led/datatools/doc/OnTheMap2010Geography.pdf.

       [ST] = lowercase, 2-letter postal code for a chosen state
       [PART] = Part of the state file, can have a value of either “main” or “aux”. Complimentary parts of
                the state file, the main part includes jobs with both workplace and residence in the state
                and the aux part includes jobs with the workplace in the state and the residence outside of
                the state.

       [SEG] = Segment of the workforce, can have the values of “S000”, “SA01”, “SA02”, “SA03”,
                “SE01”, “SE02”, “SE03”, “SI01”, “SI02”, or “SI03”. These correspond to the same
                segments of the workforce as are listed in the OD file structure above.
       [TYPE] = Job Type, can have a value of “JT00” for All Jobs, “JT01” for Primary Jobs, “JT02” for
                All Private Jobs, “JT03” for Private Primary Jobs, “JT04” for All Federal Jobs, or “JT05”
                for Federal Primary Jobs.
       [YEAR] = Year of job data. Can have the value of 2002-2011 for most states.

Geography Crosswalk
Filenames of the geography crosswalk datasets are described by the following template:
[ST]_xwalk.csv.gz where

         [ST] = lowercase, 2-letter postal code for a chosen state

As an example the geography crosswalk file for Michigan would be the file: mi_xwalk.csv.gz

Code Vintages
The primary key/identifier in the Geography Crosswalk is the 2010 Census Tabulation Block
Code (tabblk2010). This code does not change between Decennial Censuses and can be used to
link to the geocodes in the OD/RAC/WAC files. All other geographic codes in the crosswalk are
“current” and represent the most recent definitions of the legal, statistical, or administrative areas
as integrated into LODES and OnTheMap.

   All codes are constructed to be nationally unique. For areas that do not have a FIPS or other identifier that is
nationally unique, the State FIPS or both State and County FIPS codes are prepended to create uniqueness. Source
information for each geography can be found at
http://lehd.ces.census.gov/applications/help/onthemap.html#!geographic_data.
14
   States with At Large districts have a district code of “00”. State equivalents with Resident Commissioners or
Delegates have a district code of “98”.
